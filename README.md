# Personal Portfolio

- Live Demo

## Objective

To create a responsive personal portfolio website that accommodates, at the very least, 3 different sizes (full desktop, tablet, and mobile). Full details can be found on [The Odin Project's page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-advanced-html-and-css-personal-portfolio).

**Requirements:**

There are no real requirements for this project besides needing to make the website responsive, but The Odin Project does provide guidelines and sample design layouts for how to approach the project.

## Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JS
- Webpack

## Author's Notes

Since this is my personal website, I decided to deviate from the sample layout provided and went for a somewhat pixel art and video game-inspired look to incorporate my other interests. All pixel images were created by myself using GIMP 2.10.34.

Some features I may try to implement in the future are a button to toggle dark and light themes and a button to toggle font families so it's easier to read.
